                    <p><br>My name is Mykyta Palamarchuk, I am 20 years old and am currently a student at Florida Atlantic University. I was born and raised in Ukraine where
                           I have completed elementary and middle schools after which I have moved to US where I have completed high school. I have experience in C/C++, HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
                           Java and Python, and I am frequently switching in between all of them while working on different side projects in order to imporve my mastery and knowledge. I absolutely
                           enjoy learning everything there is to learn about technology, be that about software or hardware, and I am frequently taking various courses as well as attending various
                           seminars outside of school in order to learn as much as I can about technology.</p>

                                    <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
                                    <p>I have been doing Martial Arts for <strong>over 10 years</strong> now. This includes Kick-boxing, Karate, BJJ, and Kung-fu. Because of the "nature" of Ukraine, I had plenty of opportunities to enhance my Martial Arts skills, and because of the combination of all of the different types that I tried out, I was able to developed my own techniques that are way more practical and effective than a single type of the martial arts. Some of the gyms that I would recommend around the area are <a href="https://btboca.com/">Big Time Boxing</a> and <a href="https://americantopteam.com/">American Top Team</a>.</p>

                                    <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
                                    <p>Cybersecurity is a new hobby of mine. I first tried it when I was invited to a pilot cybersecurity class in my high school senior year, and almost immediately I was completely taken over by the desire to learn more about it, in fact, the only reason I am majoring in Computer Science is to get into a Cybersecurity program in FAU. By now I have completed over a dozen courses and am preparing for a major certification in this field. In my opinion, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> is one of the best websites where you can go to learn about cybersecurity and a lot of other stuff, many professionals post their courses there for very cheap prices.</p>

                                    <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
                                    <p>It has only been a few months since I started doing Rock Climbing and I have to say that it is definitely one of the best things I have ever tried out. The sense of achievement every time I make that hard jump or reach the top of the trail is simply overwhelming. <a href="https://projectrock.com/">Project ROCK</a> is an extremely good gym for rock climbing with friendly staff and supportive people, people of all levels will find that place to be really good.</p>

                                    <h3>Sky Diving</h3>
                                    <p>Skydiving is probably the riskiest activity I have been doing so far. I have only jumped from the plane once, however, I frequently go to do indoor skydiving which lets you experience freefall and learn how to control your body to the fullest. <a href="https://www.iflyworld.com/">IFLY</a> offers an indoor skydiving experience and training for people of all levels, and although it is quite expansive, it is definitely worth it to go there at least once.</p>

                                    <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
                                    <p>Snowboarding is that hobby that I come back to every year. Sadly, I can't snowboard all the time so I have to wait up until winter before I can go and do it again. I have been snowboarding for<strong> 6 years </strong>now and am pretty proficient in it, although I cannot do any advanced tricks on a board yet. Every winter, I usually go to the <a href="https://www.beechmountainresort.com/">Beech Mountain Resort</a> to snowboard, and I have to say that although it is not as fancy as many other places, it is also extremely cheap in comparison to other famous resorts and is a good place for newcomers to try things out.</p>

                    <h3 id="Awards">My Achievements:</h3>
                    <p>Due to the extensive list of hobbies, I have gotten quite a few achievements throughout my life. When it comes to sports, I have gotten a black belt in Karate and 3rd place in youth kickboxing competition in central Ukraine. I have gotten quite a few unofficial certificates in Cybersecurity and 3rd place in Gold Division in Cyberpatriot competition in Florida. I have also participated in various mathematical competitions in Ukraine where each year I would come out in the top 3. Apart from that, I was able to become a team captain of a competitive robotics team called <a href="https://www.dirtymechanics.org/">Dirty Mechanics</a> in 2018-2019 after being in a team for only 2 years.</p>

                    <h3 id="Role">My Role in Group 23:</h3>
                    <p>During our innitial team meeting, we have decided that we will be working on a video game for our group project. This particular project will require 2 main groups, which are
                       programmers and designers. As I have indicated in my Bio, I have quite a bit of experience with programming, furthermore, I have already made some simple video games as a part of
                       my little projects for self improvement, therefore, I can contribute greatly as a programmer for the team. In addition to that, I do have some basic experience
                       with character modeling and development, so I could partially take on a role of a designer if a quick substitution is needed.</p>
